This guide walks you through writing a simple AngularJS client that consumes a Spring MVC-based link:/understanding/REST[RESTful web service].

== What you'll build

You will build an AngularJS client that consumes a Spring-based RESTful web service.
Specifically, the client will consume the service created in {gs-rest-service-cors}[Building a RESTful Web Service with CORS].

The AngularJS client will be accessed by opening the `index.html` file in your browser, and will consume the service accepting requests at:

    http://rest-service.guides.spring.io/greeting

The service will respond with a link:/understanding/JSON[JSON] representation of a greeting:

[source,json]
----
{"id":1,"content":"Hello, World!"}
----

The AngularJS client will render the ID and content into the DOM.

NOTE: The service at rest-service.guides.spring.io is running the code from the 
{gs-rest-service-cors}[CORS guide] with small modifications:
there is open access to the `/greeting` endpoint because the app is using 
`@CrossOrigin` with no domain.

== What you'll need

 - About 15 minutes
 - A favorite text editor
 - A modern web browser
 - An internet connection

== Create an AngularJS Controller

First, you will create the AngularJS controller module that will consume the REST service: 

`public/hello.js`
[source,js]
----
include::complete/public/hello.js[]
----

This controller module is represented as a simple JavaScript function that is given AngularJS's `$scope` and `$http` components.
It uses the `$http` component to consume the REST service at "/greeting".

If successful, it will assign the JSON returned back from the service to `$scope.greeting`, effectively setting a model object named "greeting".
By setting that model object, AngularJS can bind it to the application page's DOM, rendering it for the user to see.

== Create the Application Page

Now that you have an AngularJS controller, you will create the HTML page that will load the controller into the user's web browser:

`public/index.html`
[source,html]
----
include::complete/public/index.html[]
----

Note the following two script tags within the `head` section.

[source,html]
----
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.0.8/angular.min.js"></script>
<script src="hello.js"></script>
----

The first script tag loads the minified AngularJS library (**angular.min.js**) from a content delivery network (CDN) so that you don't have to download AngularJS and place it in your project.
It also loads the controller code (**hello.js**) from the application's path.

The AngularJS library enables several custom attributes for use with standard HTML tags.
In index.html, two such attributes are in play:

 * The `<html>` tag has the `ng-app` attribute to indicate that this page is an AngularJS application.
 * The `<div>` tag has the `ng-controller` attribute set to reference `Hello`, the controller module.

Also note the two `<p>` tags which use placeholders (identified by double-curly-braces).

[source,html]
----
<p>The ID is {{greeting.id}}</p>
<p>The content is {{greeting.content}}</p>
----

The placeholders reference the `id` and `content` properties of the `greeting` model object which will be set upon successfully consuming the REST service.

[[run]]
== Run the client

To run the client, you'll need to serve it from a web server to your browser. The Spring Boot CLI (Command Line Interface) includes an embedded Tomcat server, which offers a simple approach to serving web content. See {gs-spring-boot}[Building an Application with Spring Boot] for more information about installing and using the CLI.

In order to serve static content from Spring Boot's embedded Tomcat server, you'll also need to create a minimal amount of web application code so that Spring Boot knows to start Tomcat. The following `app.groovy` script is sufficient for letting Spring Boot know that you want to run Tomcat:

`app.groovy`
[source,groovy]
----
include::complete/app.groovy[]
----

You can now run the app using the Spring Boot CLI:

----
spring run app.groovy
----

Once the app starts, open http://localhost:8080 in your browser, where you see:

image::images/hello.png[Model data retrieved from the REST service is rendered into the DOM.]

The ID value will increment each time you refresh the page.

== Summary

Congratulations! You've just developed an AngularJS client that consumes a Spring-based RESTful web service.
